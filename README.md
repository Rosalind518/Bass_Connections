## Bass Connection - Deep Learning and Remote Sensing for Coastal Resilience and Disaster Response (2019-2020)

### NOTE: this readme and whole repo is still in development and changing constantly.

This website is specifically for students working on the 2019-2020 Bass Connections project but could be of interest to a wider ranger of folks interested in learning about scientific computing for geospatial analysis, remote sensing for change detection, and combining remote sensing with new deep learning and computer vision techniques.

### Project Overview ([full description](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/deep-learning-and-remote-sensing-coastal-resilience-and-disaster-response-2019-2020)):

![Crystal Coast Before and After](https://github.com/patrickcgray/Bass_Connections/blob/master/before_after_flo_outflow.png)

The purpose of this project is to use Hurricane Florence's impacts on North Carolinaâ€™s coastline to develop a methodology for rapid and high-resolution monitoring of coastal areas in the face of storm impacts. We will do so by leveraging convolution neural networks (CNNs) to automate change detection in satellite imagery. The change detected via satellite will trigger a time-series of UAS surveys for areas that experienced substantial change.

#### Outcomes:

* Development of habitat classification and change detection tool for satellite imagery
* Publication in peer-reviewed journal. Potentially publishing on comparison of different methods, data inputs, model architectures for creating the best classifier for Southeast US coastal environments and or publishing on the methods and results of the tip-and-cue surveys to understand impact and recovery from Hurricane Florence
* Lay the foundation for future research and grants to explore using a coordinated satellite and drone system to monitor and evaluate ecosystem services provided by coastal habitats

### Spring Semester Independent Study

This independept study will have three components: self-led learning, a journal club, and an independent project.

#### Potential Projects:
All of these are flexible and will be dependent on student interests and skills but provide a starting place.

* initial CNN based classification of satellite and drone imagery
* paper on tip-and-cue methods and applications in storm/disaster response
* methods for analyzing and visualizing geospatial data using open source tools like python, jupyter notebooks, etc
  *   * https://github.com/HyperionAnalytics/PyDataNYC2014
* Docker based API capable of ingesting imagery and outputting a classified map 
  * we will develop the model to do the classifying during the summer, but just the API 
* interactive website capable of visualizing maps, images, and classified products
* exploring new CNN architectures for analyzing remote sensing data
* paper discussing how rapid monitoring can facilitate management of coastal areas
* novel ways to visualize geospatial data
